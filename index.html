            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Greetings! My name is Sameer Ramkissoon, I'm 17 years old and currently live in Queens, New York. 
                Recently, I just graduated from Thomas A. Edison CTE High School and will attend the New York Institute of Technology starting in Fall 2022.
                My passions focus mainly on the topic of Computer Science, but my hobbies vary greatly.
                Volleyball, boxing, anime, and gaming are just a few of the activities I take great interest in.
                To see my life on a personal level, some of my contact information below is provided at the bottom of the page.
            </p>

                Started watching anime in the 5th grade, and I honestly can't seem to put it down after all these years. 
                So many genres, characters, and philosophies just tie together neatly.
                My first anime was Attack on Titan (highly recommend by the way) and now I am taking on one of the biggest challenges; catching up with One Piece.
                At the moment, it is one of the longest running anime currently being shown, so trying to make it to recent episodes is a struggle.
                However, I am thoroughly enjoying how the story is going thus far.
